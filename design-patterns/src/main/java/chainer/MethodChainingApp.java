//Use Cases for Method Chaining
//Method chaining is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to configure and build complex objects, such as configuration settings, builders, or data processing. Here are a few examples of where method chaining shines:
//
//Database Query Builders: Creating SQL queries with chained methods for SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN clauses.
//GUI Frameworks: Configuring graphical user interfaces with methods for layout, styling, and event handling.
//Fluent Interfaces: Designing APIs that provide a natural and expressive language for developers.
//Stream Processing: Chaining operations on streams, as seen in Javaâ€™s Stream API.
